        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
            Children without families are the most vulnerable people in the world. They lack all the happiness of the world. We all can't even 
            imagine the pain they go through. They always hope for having someone to love and care for. If we the people who are blessed with 
            this wondrous life take even one step forward to help them then they can too be able to live their life with the same ease and joy.
        </p><p>
            We student organization Creative Beast have started an initiative to help the needy children among us. We started PARYAAS that is a 
            small step to help those children to fulfill their needs and motivate them to have dreams. We always starve to spread happiness among all. 
            We visit various orphanages, schools, streets and help them with food, clothing, and gifts. Not only the necessary things we also flourish 
            them with love and care. We spent the whole day with them and listen to their wishes and try to fulfill them. We sometimes bring them to 
            our place so as to let them feel connected with others and enjoy this beautiful world. We take them to beautiful places, 
            fresh environments and let them explore the amazing surroundings. We have connected our every event with this initiative and sometimes 
            we invite them to our event where they can witness the live events and enjoy. They take various memories with them and feel blessed 
            and happy.
        </p><p>
            We know this one-day happiness is not enough for them to live happily but at least we can try to make their life worth so that they 
            can think of having dreams, to live their life to the fullest. If we all stand together then we can at least provide them with one 
            reason to think big and achieve it.
        </p><p>
            We feel the reason we are all here, our purpose of being, is to help others find their little piece of happiness and heaven right here 
            on earth.
        </p>

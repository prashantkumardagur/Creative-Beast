        <p>
            Childhood, Yes those were the days! Fabulous, Glorious, Glamorous, Marvelous. Life is a story with different phases and one big phase 
            that is invincible is our Childhood. Without any doubt, childhood is the most enjoyable period of life. No one would deny the pleasure 
            of being a child. No one is as innocent as a child and sadly none can ever be a child always but we can enjoy the moments by creating 
            a virtual environment of our childhood that could remind us of our childhood.
        </p><p>
            So to take all of us back to our precious phase of life student organization Creative Beast is coming up with its next mega event 
            “Bring Your Childhood Back”. This event will reflect all the childhood memories with lots of fun and joy. Each and everything that 
            describes our childhood would be available in this event. Starting from eatables to childhood games to cartoons, every valuable moment 
            of our Childhood life will be there. As soon as you will enter the childhood arena, you will feel like you are in a dream that is back 
            to your childhood and seems to be full of memories. What not will be available? I guess everything, you will witness the biggest event
